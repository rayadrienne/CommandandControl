# Setup Guide for VMware Workstation Pro and Windows & Ubuntu Virtual Machines

Welcome to this guide on setting up VMware Workstation Pro for personal purposes, and installing Windows and Ubuntu Server virtual machines (VMs).

## Setting Up VMware Workstation Pro

VMware Workstation Pro is a powerful virtualization software that allows users to run multiple operating systems on a single physical machine. Here's how you can set it up for personal use.

### 1. Install VMware Workstation Pro

First, ensure you download and install version 17.6 of VMware Workstation Pro, as it is now free for personal use.

### 3. Download Windows 11 VM

You can obtain a pre-configured Windows 11 virtual machine, optimized for developers, from the official Windows Developer website:

[Download Windows 11 VM](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads/virtual-machines/)

> **Note:** This VM has an expiration date, after which you can re-download if needed. For instance, the VM I used will expire on October 23rd, 2024.

### 4. Import and Configure Windows 11 VM

- Once your download is complete, extract the contents and double-click the `.ovf` file. 
- Choose to open the file with VMware and set a name and storage path for the VM. Consider including the experiment date in the VM's title for easy reference.

## Installing Ubuntu Server on VMware

### 1. Download Ubuntu Server ISO

Get the image file for Ubuntu Server using the following link:

[Download Ubuntu Server 22.04.1 ISO](https://releases.ubuntu.com/22.04.1/ubuntu-22.04.1-live-server-amd64.iso)

### 2. Create a New VM for Ubuntu Server

- Select "Create a New Virtual Machine" on the VMWare Home tab.
- For the installer disc image file, choose the downloaded Ubuntu ISO.

### 3. Adjust Hardware Specifications

Lower the disk size to what's practical for your use caseâ€”I chose 14GB, though 20GB is recommended.

### Customize Hardware

Navigate to the next configuration screen to adjust your hardware settings.

#### Memory and Processors

- On the **Customize Hardware** page, consider reducing the memory allocation. For example, a reduction from 4GB to 2GB is acceptable for most scenarios.
- Maintain the number of processors at 2 for balanced performance.

### Network Configuration

Before continuing, it's essential to identify the network settings for your virtual environment.

#### Retrieve Network Information

- From the VMware Workstation menu, select **Edit > Virtual Network Editor**.
- Choose the NAT network option and click on **NAT Settings** to view the details.

![Network Editor](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/48420ff5-08a1-4434-a863-7fdd4dbf82d5)

Document the Subnet IP and Gateway IP addresses as these will be required for the Ubuntu server network configuration.

#### Manual Network Setup

After collecting the network information, proceed with the network setup by selecting **Manual** configuration during the VM setup process.

![Network Configuration Selection](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/89f5a885-0f08-478f-aed0-86e9109ec5f3)

Input the Subnet and Gateway IPs you have noted and append `/24` to the Subnet IP to denote the subnet size.

For the Address field, use the suggested DHCPv4 address, excluding the CIDR notation.

![DHCPv4 Address Input](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/77fd3ad4-1ddb-4ad0-ad9f-bfbb6c2b533c)

Record the designated static IP address; it will be necessary for subsequent stages in the setup.

### Finalizing Ubuntu Server Installation

After setting the network configuration, complete the installation by providing a server name, username, and password. Additionally, enable the OpenSSH server to allow remote access.

In the event the installation process stalls, pressing enter can assist in resuming the setup.

Once installation completes, you will be prompted to log in with the credentials you have chosen.
