- Download the VMware version of Windows 11 from Windows Developer here: https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads/virtual-machines/
- Be mindful of the expiration date of this virtual machine. For example, mine will only last until October 23rd, 2024. If I need another one after that, I can always download it again.

- It will take a few minutes to download. Once complete, unzip the downloaded package and double click on the .ovf file. Choose to open the file with VMWare. Provide a name and storage path for the VM. (I put the exp. date in the title of this VM and kept the default storage location)
